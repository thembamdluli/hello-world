# hello-world
This is my repository for practicing the GitHub Flow

this is the start of my journey of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer

My name is Themba, I have delayed my programming journey since I had been busy with other stuff. I feel like it's time to fully immerse myself on this journey. I know how tough it is but I am going to perservere until I reach my goal. 

I have been busy learning HTML and CSS, recently started learning JavaScript.

In fact I am already a Full Stack Web Developer (speaking it into existence).
